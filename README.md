## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains details about various books (e.g., title, author, rating, number of reviews, etc.). It can be any dataset that includes book popularity metrics. Feel free to replace it with your own dataset if needed.

---

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality.
2. **Popularity Calculation**: Popularity is determined using metrics like the number of ratings, average rating, and review count.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: A ranking algorithm sorts books based on popularity scores and recommends the top books.

---

## ✨ Example

Given a dataset with books' ratings and reviews, the system ranks the books based on a popularity score. The output could look something like:

```plaintext
Recommended Books:
1. Book A - Rating: 4.8, Reviews: 2000
2. Book B - Rating: 4.7, Reviews: 1500
3. Book C - Rating: 4.6, Reviews: 1800
```
